    <p>So my second project of LM will be a separate project since I really like the way that my Project Hub page looks
        like and, unfortunately, I did not do that 100% by myself</p>
    <p>In any case, I'd like to print here some text, so I will just do whatever comes into my mind.</p>
    <p>So pretty much what I do remember from the CSS classes I really remember only the fact that CSS is pretty much
        about the clean separation of the page structure from the style.</p>
    <p>The other thing I remember is that in the style declaration in the CSS space [ ] serves as a delimiter to select
        lower hierarchy classes or objects or whatever, while coma [,] serves for the selection of the
        multiple...things...to give them the same qualities, such as color or other style things.</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about adding some tables and stuff with the gradient, for example, or some glassy effects in here. Hopefully I will be able to do so</p>
        <ol>
            <p>So in order to do so I need:</p>
            <li>Create a table</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I will call it a glass-table</li>
                <li>So it gonna be, probably, 2x2 table with some elements inside</li>
                <li>I will try to aim for a circular gradiend, because it is supposed to be some fun.</li>
                <li>Yeh, IDK why I added this line, I really had something in mind and then I just forgot, nvm</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Find a way to create some gradient</li>
            <ol>
                <li>So it gonna be 2x2, as I said before. So at first I have to just create it.</li>
                <li>Aigh, after that - I'm going to give it a name and give it some propperties in the CSS.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
            <li>Add a glassy effect, because I like those</li>
            <li>Do that and feel myself like a superior programmer</li>
        </ol>

        <table class="glass-table">
            <tr>
                <td>Cell A</td>
                <td>Cell B</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cell C</td>
                <td>Cell D</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
